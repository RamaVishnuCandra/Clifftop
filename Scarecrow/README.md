this folder is for my “[Scarecrow of Oz](https://sites.google.com/site/tri9vikrama/)” Google Site

it's presently only one page, so I'll work with it here

# Scarecrow of Oz

I've got a number of sites I'm trying to work with in relation to different audiences. My primary interest presently (March 6th, 2019) is with GitHub and version control. A close second interest is semantic wikiing with Referata. But I'd like to maintain a good presentation with this Google Site, which has a type of stability that gives value to my overall sense of what I'm doing.

This exact version right now that I'm working with as I'm typing is partially for the Google Sites medium, partially for the GitHub versioin control process. I'm thinking that I'm learning how to construct my pages using GitHub, which has a great arrangement for comparing them and for managing the process of updating, with lots of opportunity to begin to make notes about the change-making process itself.

But I'm hoping to soon give the Google Site better form, with explanation, and links, and all that. Once I get these two working better with each other, I'd like to get the semantic version into a workable relationship with them also. Thanks.

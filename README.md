## my learning process

My own study in life these days is knowledge representation, and information theory and organization. I'm especially interested in the qualification of metadata, and I like the standardization work of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). I have a history of interest with Vaiṣṇavism, but have stayed closer to a reparative interest with government even if my earliest years were partially uncivilized. Bibliography and similar intellectual interests are helping me put my life back together.

I've found the wiki environment pretty suitable for my type of programming interest, but am enjoying learning how to work with semantic wikiing ([Referata](http://referata.com) is a great site). Said semantic environment seems right for my own level of metadative qualification. It provides well for a static audience.

However, in the dynamic process of developing the quality of work we might like to achieve with metadata information, version control is gaining my interest. So, I'm going to experiment with the tools offered on this site to see what I can learn further, and what I can do with my own management of my writings and the (though elementary) programming behind the associative metadata that might be called upon by researchers into the designs and processes I've been working with.

### other people’s concerns

Through the course of my life, I've met with various accusations of falsity and malicious intent. However, I continue to be very genuine in my striving to maintain a lifestyle of peace. It just happens to be that I work with some ideas that numerous people, for often very different reasons each, disapprove, sometimes to the degree of trying to dismiss or even fight me.

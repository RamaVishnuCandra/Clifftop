## my learning process

My own study in life these days is knowledge representation, and information theory and organization. I'm especially interested in the qualification of metadata, and I like the standardization work of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). I have a history of interest with Vaiṣṇavism, but have stayed closer to a reparative interest with government even if my earliest years were partially uncivilized. Bibliography and similar intellectual interests are helping me put my life back together.

I've found the wiki environment pretty suitable for my type of programming interest, but am enjoying learning how to work with semantic wikiing ([Referata](http://referata.com) is a great site). Said semantic environment seems right for my own level of metadative qualification. It provides well for a static audience.

However, in the dynamic process of developing the quality of work we might like to achieve with metadata information, version control is gaining my interest. So, I'm going to experiment with the tools offered on this site (GitHub) to see what I can learn further, and what I can do with my own management of my writings and the (though elementary) programming behind the associative metadata that might be called upon by researchers into the designs and processes I've been working with.

### other people’s concerns

Through the course of my life, I've met with various accusations of falsity and malicious intent. However, I continue to be very genuine in my striving to maintain a lifestyle of peace. It just happens to be that I work with some ideas that numerous people, for often very different reasons each, disapprove, sometimes to the degree of trying to dismiss or even fight me.

The essence of the conflict is quite simple, and immediately upon recognizing what it is, mostly anyone can make sense of why there would have been conflict in my life. I've chosen to be willing to consider that I could be the reincarnation of Jesus. In and of itself, that's enough for the average audience to question my sanity and ensure distance between their lives and mine.

However, there is more to my own life, and more to life in general, than what that would mean for me to be wrestling with that specific identity. Knowledge representation and information theory, in general, is a valuable interest, and learning how to work with some of the more programmable environments on the Internet nowadays can help many of us survive. My efforts are valid enough in their own right, even if I were just curious and have a liking to “keep up with the Joneses” if I can.

Ecclesiastical proselytization and political agendas would be unwelcome with many otherwise typical associates. If you don't like my writings or my exploration of the tools by which to work with metadata and even the documentation of my own learning process, including where I see how version control techniques could help my thinking and revisioning, then recognize that you don't have to be devoutly audience to my expressions. Of course, an environment like this should be what safe is, but if you can't find me actually committing acts of ill intent, then please limit that type of accusation that is merely based on your own ecclesio-political leaning.

Whatever it is I am, it probably compares to numerous minority lifestyles if it's unusual. I think for myself, including in relation to godliness and identification and spiritual metaphysics and so forth. But I also like learning how to write and revise semantically, and so forth. Thanks.
